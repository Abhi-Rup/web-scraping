# Web Scraping
Web scraping consists in gathering data available on websites. This can be done manually by a human user or by a bot. The latter can of course gather data much faster than a human user and that is why we are going to focus on this. Is it therefore technically possible to collect all the data of a website in a matter of minutes this kind of bot.
